# Experiment 3: Supply Chain Transparency for Luxury Goods
## Aim:
To develop a smart contract that tracks the supply chain of luxury goods, ensuring authenticity.
## Algorithm:
The manufacturer records product creation details on-chain.


The product moves through different supply chain checkpoints.


The ownership of the product can be transferred securely.


Buyers can verify the productâ€™s authenticity.

    function transferOwnership(uint256 productId, address newOwner) public {

    function verifyProduct(uint256 productId) public view returns (string memory, address, bool) {
        Product memory p = products[productId];
        return (p.name, p.currentOwner, p.verified);

```
## Expected Output:
A luxury good (e.g., a Rolex watch) is registered on-chain.


Ownership is transferred at every checkpoint.


Buyers can check the authenticity before purchasing.

## High-Level Overview:
Helps prevent counterfeit luxury goods.


Teaches real-world supply chain use cases.

## RESULT : 
Thus, the execution of the suplly chain Transpanrency for Luxury Goods has executed successfully.
